He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood
He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it
He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where he had left his two brothers
He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet
He rose up without delay, eager to start on his way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which direction he ought to go
He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber
He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full
He sent to the little tailor and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one request to make to him
He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow's rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it
He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very fishes whose lives he had saved
He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead
He thought about it for a long time, and at last found good counsel
He thought it so beautiful that he got up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his slippers
He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights
He told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died
He took her at her word, and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:
He took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded
He took the ring which she had given him off his finger, and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom
He travelled about a long time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out
He waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it
He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door
He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on the lovely scenes around him
He wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats
He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber
He was certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice
He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul
He was old, however, and had a long white beard
He was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again
He was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil
He was still cursing when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest
He was undecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he said yes
He was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds
He went and listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods
He went down again, and as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest full of gold out with him
He went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible
He went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top
He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also
Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed friend, who seemed so anxious for his company
Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad
Heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value upon them
Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived
Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her
Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed
Here are fifty talers for you
Here I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of precious stones
Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger
His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep
His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again
His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head, and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well
His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died
His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it
His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home
His son and his son's wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it
His son married the beautiful maiden whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they are still alive or not, is known to God
His sons were very much grieved at their father's sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter
How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got?
How happy my mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.'
How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels
However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard the same good counsel
However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?
However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about
However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again
However, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them if they would go in peace or not
However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.' Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care
However, I'm off now once for all: I like your cow now a great deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a nosegay
However, on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been
However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care no light should fall upon him
However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the walls
However, the duck, who slept in the open air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach
However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt
However, they all set out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill
However, they lifted her up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again
I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.' The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat
I am also the soldier that overset your stall
I am quite innocent
I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold
I brought you there because I really loved you
I cannot let myself be seen by my people
I don't care whose pig it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me
I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!'
I have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.'
I have been to the sun, the moon, and the night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome the dragon
I have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me
I have long been waiting for an opportunity to escape.'
I have much the best of the bargain
I killed two giants, I brought away one unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing outside the room.' When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against him
I luckily slipped through her fingers.'
I must first, however, prove whether all you have told me about your three things is true.' The robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer visible
I should be sorry if it were.' The woman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg
I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.' All this, however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to be godmother
I smote seven at one blow
I want to have something given to me.' Gretel presents Hans with a knife
I was dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire's pig
I will also give thee this nut,' continued the night-wind
I will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.' The boy placed himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in
I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.' Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes
I will put them into my pillow, and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking
I will see you no more.'
I will still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as I bid you
I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!' Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone
If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden
If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.'
If someone would but tell me!'
If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him
If you desire nothing more than that, I can easily keep it in mind.'
If you do all I bid you, you shall fare well
If you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you
Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up
Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry
In a forest of his country lived two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in danger of death
In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them
In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow
In another room he saw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took
In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses
In front of the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket
In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree
In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to be found
In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket
In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble
In the door there was a golden key, and when she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning away very busily
In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand
In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further
In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead
In the evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel
In the garden behind the house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me
In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him
In the meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the young men stay so long
In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were attracted and descended on it in hosts

In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table
In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her

In the morning the soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home
In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl
In the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child's head off

In the village I just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty
In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob
In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.'
In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen
In vain he declared his innocence; he was dismissed with no better answer
Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work
Instantly the transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him, who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this time she had attended to his house-keeping
Instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron Hans

It so happened that his road one day led through a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady by her side looking about them
It tasted so good to her—so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before
It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone
It was found at the soldier's, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison
It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under

It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards

It would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook
Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be parted from one another for ever
Jorinda was just singing,
Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot
Jorindel turned to see the reason, and beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended with a mournful jug, jug
Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this
Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain
Joy was in every face and every heart
Jump as I did, if you can do it.' The giant made the attempt but he could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand

Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!' The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could
Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.'
Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company: however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily
Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till she came to the oven
Likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough
Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate

Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: 'Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would please her too
Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her
Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice

Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door

Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking

Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till the cask was empty
Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark
Now do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live.' The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed
Now he has got his well-deserved punishment
Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble, he felt no fatigue
Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: 'Hearken to me, you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you too must learn something by which you can earn your bread

Poor Hans was sadly frightened
Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone—but what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot where he stood
Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows, and how his master meant to kill him in the morning
Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care
Presently she came to the apple-tree
Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed

Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him

Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when there was nothing to do

Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once more spun the heap into gold
Scarcely had he spoken these words when he heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and round
Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they were looking for
Scarcely, however, had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father, but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them
Scream as he might, it would not help him
Seven at one blow, is my kind of affair.' He took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside

She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada's head against a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes
She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister
She could not see him for he still wore his cloak
She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him
She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him nor think of him without an inward shudder
She drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left school to the time he went back
She got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping
She had a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon herself in it, and say:
She had not been there long before she heard that the king's eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out
She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red
She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the wolf!' Then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made his voice soft with it
She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast
She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone
She laid her kerchief over me,
She laid her kerchief over me,
she let the hair down
She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly
She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss
She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand
She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast
She related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune
She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming in every direction
She replied, 'Go farther into the wood until you come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me
She said to the mouse: 'You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for a day alone
She said: 'I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down
She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere
She sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found
She sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, 'Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived with you in the hut
She stepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned throughout
She took care to do everything according to the old woman's bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes
She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool to rest upon when she should be weary
She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red
She tried to excuse herself by saying that she would not be able to find the way thither
She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest, darkest part of the forest
She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them
She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married
She was so terrified at this, that she ran crying and screaming to her mother
She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw
She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:
She went into the kitchen, but found no one
She went into the room to the bed
She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples
She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off
She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes
Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to be
Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother's little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it
Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave
Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it

So he began, and told all the story of the princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave thus
So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her
So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom
So he kissed all three, and bid them goodbye
So he laid himself down, and sleep fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was striking a quarter to twelve
So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream

So he turned his horse and brought her also back again
So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger
So he went up to a neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock, and thus passed unknown into the town
So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the wheel again, and whistled and sang:
So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always agreed that, after all, there's no place lik!
So Mother Holle very soon got tired off her, and told her she might go
So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life

So she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes
So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy
So she tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep
So she turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool herself
So she went out

So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her

Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right—all that falls to them is so much gain—all their geese are swans—all their cards are trumps—toss them which way you will, they will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so much the faster
Some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond

Sorry as he was to see his wish so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day more beautiful
Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about
Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep, that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him

The ass brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter!

The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever.'

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat's long tail standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree
The wolf answered:
The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart's content
The wolf greeted her, and said:
The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her
The wolf ran with the child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master and mistress
The wolf thought to himself: 'What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful—she will be better to eat than the old woman
The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before
The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe

The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed
The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to do
The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river's bed: luckily it was nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep that he could find no way to get out
The youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find
The youth drew out the axe and let him go
The youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers
The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth's head, and they could see that he had golden hair
The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death
The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night's lodging
Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before
